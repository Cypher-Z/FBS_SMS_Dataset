This dataset contains 14K spam messages sent from real-world Fake Base Stations in China, manually labeled under 14 categories by researchers. For privacy reasons, we released the pre-processed version of this dataset, with all contacts in the messages being anonymized. 

We expect this dataset could help other researchers move further to understand the FBS spamming ecosystem.
